In this project, I developed an program for renting TV series, offering services to customers who can choose between individual and family plans. Each customer is assigned a subscription status based on their chosen plan: Standard, Premium, Family Pack, or Canceled. Family Pack plans can include up to four customers and provide shared characteristics. When a customer cancels their subscription, their status changes to Canceled.
		
Rentals can be made per episode or for an entire season, with the rental period starting from the current system date and varying according to the subscription plan. Standard plans allow rentals for up to 4 days, Premium for up to 7 days, and Family Packs for up to 4 days, while Canceled status does not permit rentals. The system initializes with an undefined current date, limiting most rental-related operations until the date is set.	
		
For this project we had to implement and use custom data structures such as Single Linked List and Hash Tables.
